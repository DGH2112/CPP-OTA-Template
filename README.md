Description

This is a RAD Studio wizard / expert / plug-in which example in C++ Builder
to demonstrate how to build Open Tools API projects for the RAD Studio IDEs
with C++.

At the moment the project only implements some basic Open Tool APIs examples:
 * Splash Screen;
 * About Box;
 * IDE Notifier;
 * IDE Options frame.

Eventually this project will have the same capabilities as its Pascal cousin
and be able to create the template files for a C++ Builder OTA project.
